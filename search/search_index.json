Here are examples that were created with this website: Jonah, Mark, John, and Johannine epistles with Farsi glosses Old Testament with English glosses New Testament with English glosses The goal is to help someone who understands the original languages to be able to read the Bible without constantly having to refer to a dictionary or a parsing chart. They are very helpful for people who have studied the languages for a year or so, and need a bridge to be able to read the Bible fluently in the original languages. You can make a reader\u2019s Bible for your language! This is a website that will help you to produce your own reader\u2019s Bibles. We\u2019ve worked hard to make it as simple as possible. You will get high quality PDFs or web pages, as you can see in the samples above. How much work is this? This is what you will provide: You provide the glosses for the words. You translate the grammatical terms (indicative, subjunctive, qal, niphal, etc.) Here is what we can provide: All of the parsing is already done. You don\u2019t have to gloss the same word over and over. You just translate \u201c\u0394\u03b1\u03c5\u1f76\u03b4\u201d once, and after that you just click to confirm. We will generate a nice PDF, which you can distribute. The hope here is that people from all over the world will be able to benefit from these wonderful resources. The Bible is for everyone Reader\u2019s Bibles are generally published by for-profit companies. They need to cover the expense of producing the book. This has two consequences. First, the books are rather expensive (like a textbook). Second, reader\u2019s Bibles are generally only available in languages that have a lot of customers. A personal invitation and challenge Learning Greek and Hebrew is a lot of work! In the English-speaking world, we are blessed with many valuable resources. Many people around the world can only learn Greek or Hebrew if they learn a second academic language first\u2014perhaps English, German, Spanish, or French. If that describes you: well done! Those of us who learned in our native language from the beginning are in awe of your hard work and dedication. We would like to challenge you here to think about your fellow countrymen. You have overcome a lot of obstacles and difficulties to be able to read the Bible in the original languages. Will you now help others to get there as well? Will you help the next generation, so that they don\u2019t have to go through all of the difficult work that you did? The goal of this website is to make it as easy as possible to produce a reader\u2019s Bible in your language. It is still not easy, but it is as easy as it can be. It will also take care of all of the publishing difficulties. So there should be very little holding you back. Can you commit a short time each day to work on developing a resource that will help future generations? You can get started today. You can probably finish a short book like Ruth, 1 John, or Jonah in a couple of hours!","title":"Home"},{"location":"#open-readers-bibles","text":"A reader\u2019s Bible is a Bible that has the original language text of the Bible, along with glosses, parsings, and footnotes that help people to understand the text.

If that\u2019s not you, no problem! You may want to read the publication overview instead, which will allow you to customize a great deal without having to do anything technical. What do I need to understand? This page assumes a very basic familiarity with GitHub and a working knowledge of XeLaTeX. If you\u2019re not familiar with XeLaTeX: it\u2019s a computer typesetting system that creates PDF files. There are plenty of resources online to learn, but it does have a rather steep learning curve. (If you have friends in mathematics, science, or engineering, they may be familiar with it.) The project repository If you want to publish the books on your own, you\u2019ll want to get ahold of those files. There are two ways you can get to the GitHub repository: The name of the repository follows a fixed format. It\u2019s always pub-XXXXX where XXXXX is the project ID. For instance, for the bhsa project, you can find the repository at https://github.com/openreadersbibles/pub-bhsa . From the \u201cProjects\u201d screen, click the \u201cAdvanced\u2026\u201d button and then \u201cGitHub.\u201d The repository\u2019s GitHub page will open in a new window. Types of files you\u2019ll find The data for the project are stored in a SQL database in the cloud. During publication, the data for each book are put into two intermediate formats. Different files are created for each book. The filenames have formats like bhsa_OT_JON.xml : bhsa is the project ID, OT is the canon, and JON is the book code (for Jonah). For the book of Jonah, we would get two data files: bhsa_OT_JON.json contains raw(-ish) JSON data. (See \u201cUsing the TypeScript\u201d below for help in using this.) bhsa_OT_JON.xml is an XML representation of the book in TEI format . bhsa_OT_JON.json is placed in the root directory of the publication repository. bhsa_OT_JON.xml , however, will be in a subfolder specific to the publication configuration . (The location for the default publication configuration is default/bhsa_OT_JON.xml .) These files differ in their contents. The JSON file is more or less raw data from the database. There are columns that represent parsing data, for instance. The XML file, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t have all of the raw data but includes parsing information that is created by a particular publication configuration. Here is the JSON content of a certain word in Obadiah 1:11: { \"_id\": 298325, \"g_word_utf8\": \"\u05e9\u05c1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b9\u05a5\u05d5\u05ea\", \"trailer_utf8\": \" \", \"voc_lex_utf8\": \"\u05e9\u05c1\u05d1\u05d4\", \"gn\": \"unknown\", \"nu\": \"unknown\", \"st\": \"c\", \"vt\": \"infc\", \"vs\": \"qal\", \"ps\": \"unknown\", \"pdp\": \"verb\", \"freq_lex\": 47, \"gloss\": { \"type\": \"word\", \"_gloss\": \"take captive\" }, \"qere_utf8\": \"\", \"kq_hybrid_utf8\": \"\", \"prs_gn\": \"NA\", \"prs_nu\": \"NA\", \"prs_ps\": \"NA\", \"reference\": \"OT OBA 1:11\", \"lex_id\": 1438314, \"phrasalGlosses\": [] }, You can see that the field vt (=verb tense) has infc (=infinitive construct).

The note marker \u201cb\u201d (from n=\"b\" ) comes from a publication configuration. A different project might format that parsing in a completely different way. Making TeX and HTML files Then XSLT transformations are used to create .tex and .html files from the .xml file. bhsa_OT_JON.html is created by tei2html.xsl . bhsa_OT_JON.tex is created by tei2tex.xsl . Then a GitHub Action converts the .tex file into a PDF. If you are investigating a problem in the build, you could also switch to the gh-pages branch of the repository, and examine the bhsa_OT_JON.log file. Using TypeScript Even if you just want the data, it may be helpful to have the types that the project uses. The relevant repositories for managing the publication process are orb-server and models . If you want to do TypeScript development, you probably want the data in those files. The relative paths in the files assume that models and orb-server are at the same level. E.g., /my-custom-project /my-custom-project/models /my-custom-project/orb-server For instance, the .json file can be read and then used to create a PublicationBook object.

A more personal introduction After I finished third-semester Hebrew, I had still read very little of the Hebrew Bible. I knew that if I didn\u2019t use it, I would forget it. And so I set myself the goal of being able to read the Psalms without having to use a dictionary. After one or two years, I achieved that goal. But I was exhausted! I knew that at that rate I might never read through the entire Old Testament. Somewhat reluctantly, I bought a Hebrew reader\u2019s Bible. At first I was ashamed: I thought of it as a cheater\u2019s edition. But then I began to read from it daily, and I saw how helpful it was. After several more years, I had read completely through the Old Testament. I knew that never would have happened if I had just been relying on BHS and a dictionary. Somewhere in those years, I began to wish that there could be a reader\u2019s Bible in one of the languages that is near to my heart. I sent an email to the publisher of a Greek reader\u2019s Bible. They replied with a sensible question: how many copies did I think it would sell? But I knew that that was the end of the idea: we would be lucky to sell a few hundred copies. So I set the idea aside. As I continued to read in my reader\u2019s Bible, I thought about how it had been produced. As a computer person, I could see that a database was involved. I found myself getting distracted in my devotions, thinking about how I would code that sort of system. Fairly soon after I finished reading through the Old Testament for the first time, I was at a conference with a lot of Russians. I was doing my devotions in the hotel lobby, and a new Russian friend sat down. He was a pastor, and also fluent in English. He noticed the book, and said that he had the same one: someone had brought it in for him specially in Russia. I was glad that he too was able to use it, but I was also upset. First, he could only get that book because he knew an expatriate who could bring it in for him. Second, he could only benefit from it because he already knew English. How many more Russians would benefit from a Russian reader\u2019s Bible? How many people of other languages would also benefit?

For the Old Testament, it is recommended to gloss words that occur fewer than 50 times. A preliminary: when we talk about a \u201cword\u201d we are talking about the word you would find in the dictionary. For instance \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 is one Greek word\u2014even though it has different forms for nominative, accusative, and so forth. (And even though \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 occurs 330 times in the New Testament, it still just counts as one word.) There are 5,461 words in the New Testament. The way language works is, some words occur very frequently (like \u201cthe\u201d in English), but then most words occur far less frequently. In the New Testament, out of 5,461 words, 1,966 of them only occur once! When you\u2019re preparing a reader\u2019s Bible, you have to decide which words to gloss. For instance, for the New Testament, it typical for a publisher to say, \u201cWords that occur less than 30 times are glossed.\u201d The lower the threshold, the more words you will have to gloss; and the fewer words your reader will need to know. The chart below shows this tradeoff for the New Testament. If you gloss words occurring less than ___ times\u2026 \u2026then you will have to gloss this many words: \u2026and your reader will have to know this many words: 50 5,157 304 40 5,092 369 30 5,008 453 20 4,848 613 10 4,419 1042 As you can see in the chart below, glossing words that occur fewer than 30 times is very reasonable. It means that the reader is expected to have just 453 Greek words memorized. Most people probably have that at the end of two or three semesters. We can look at the same chart for the Old Testament. Of course, it is a lot longer. There are 9,230 words in the Old Testament. (3,071 of them only occur once!) Many reader\u2019s Bibles that have the Old Testament draw the line at 50 words. This means that the reader is expected to know 732 words. If you gloss words occurring less than ___ times\u2026 \u2026then you will have to gloss this many words: \u2026and your reader will have to know this many words: 70 8,658 572 60 8,596 634 50 8,498 732 40 8,324 906 30 8,098 1,132 20 7,732 1,498 10 6,897 2,333 Why not gloss all the words? You can certainly gloss all of the words if you wish to do so. There are two reasons you might not want to: A reader\u2019s Bible is for people who have a basic grasp of the language. People shouldn\u2019t need to look up every word. (See Reader\u2019s Bibles and Interlinear Bibles ) It will require a lot more work for you to gloss the words that occur very frequently. Although it\u2019s true there aren\u2019t many words that occur very frequently, it\u2019s also true that those words will have many more meanings. For instance, the Greek word \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 can mean \u201cword\u201d (or \u201cWord\u201d!), \u201cmessage,\u201d or \u201creport\u201d depending on the context. The more time a word occurs, the more attention it will require. If you do wish to gloss all of the words, however, you can do that by using a frequency cutoff of 7,000 for the Old Testament, and 20,000 for the New Testament.","title":"Deciding on frequency thresholds"},{"location":"frequency-thresholds/#frequency-thresholds","text":"tl;dr: For the New Testament, it is recommended to gloss words that occur fewer than 30 times. For the Old Testament, it is recommended to gloss words that occur fewer than 50 times. A preliminary: when we talk about a \u201cword\u201d we are talking about the word you would find in the dictionary. For instance \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 is one Greek word\u2014even though it has different forms for nominative, accusative, and so forth. (And even though \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 occurs 330 times in the New Testament, it still just counts as one word.) There are 5,461 words in the New Testament. The way language works is, some words occur very frequently (like \u201cthe\u201d in English), but then most words occur far less frequently. In the New Testament, out of 5,461 words, 1,966 of them only occur once! When you\u2019re preparing a reader\u2019s Bible, you have to decide which words to gloss. For instance, for the New Testament, it typical for a publisher to say, \u201cWords that occur less than 30 times are glossed.\u201d The lower the threshold, the more words you will have to gloss; and the fewer words your reader will need to know. The chart below shows this tradeoff for the New Testament. If you gloss words occurring less than ___ times\u2026 \u2026then you will have to gloss this many words: \u2026and your reader will have to know this many words: 50 5,157 304 40 5,092 369 30 5,008 453 20 4,848 613 10 4,419 1042 As you can see in the chart below, glossing words that occur fewer than 30 times is very reasonable. It means that the reader is expected to have just 453 Greek words memorized. Most people probably have that at the end of two or three semesters. We can look at the same chart for the Old Testament. Of course, it is a lot longer. There are 9,230 words in the Old Testament. (3,071 of them only occur once!) Many reader\u2019s Bibles that have the Old Testament draw the line at 50 words. This means that the reader is expected to know 732 words. If you gloss words occurring less than ___ times\u2026 \u2026then you will have to gloss this many words: \u2026and your reader will have to know this many words: 70 8,658 572 60 8,596 634 50 8,498 732 40 8,324 906 30 8,098 1,132 20 7,732 1,498 10 6,897 2,333","title":"Frequency Thresholds"},{"location":"frequency-thresholds/#why-not-gloss-all-the-words","text":"You can certainly gloss all of the words if you wish to do so.

(See Reader\u2019s Bibles and Interlinear Bibles ) It will require a lot more work for you to gloss the words that occur very frequently. Although it\u2019s true there aren\u2019t many words that occur very frequently, it\u2019s also true that those words will have many more meanings. For instance, the Greek word \u03bb\u1f79\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 can mean \u201cword\u201d (or \u201cWord\u201d!), \u201cmessage,\u201d or \u201creport\u201d depending on the context.

Mostly you will use simple glosses (the \u201c+\u201d button). If you are new to this, you don\u2019t need to worry about the others. Simple Gloss A simple gloss is just the definition of a word. This is usually what you want. (In the PDF version, it will probably also show the parsing, but you don\u2019t need to worry about that.) Remember that the system will automatically show the parsing, so you just need to enter the meaning of the word. As an example, in the English version of Matthew 1:1 , the note for the word \u201c\u0392\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\u201d looks like this: NNFS \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 book A user would just have to enter \u201cbook\u201d here: the system will put in the parsing and the lexical form of the word. Simple Gloss & Note If you want to add an explanation along with your gloss, you may make a \u201cGloss & Note.\u201d For instance, maybe you want to say, \u201cThe meaning of this word is uncertain.\u201d Staying with the previous example of Matthew 1:1 , if you added a \u201cSimple Gloss & Note\u201d it would look like this: NNFS \u03b2\u03af\u03b2\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 book . Probably it was a scroll rather than a codex. In this case, the user has written out \u201cbook\u201d for the gloss, and \u201cProbably it was a scroll rather than a codex.\u201d for the note. Here it what the screen looks like: \u201cGloss\u201d \u2014 This is the gloss, just like a simple gloss. \u201cMarkdown\u201d \u2014 Here is where you put your note. The note can include some markdown, which is described here here . This shows what your note will look like. Freeform Gloss This is like a \u201cGloss & Note\u201d but without the gloss. If for some reason you don\u2019t want to give a gloss, you can use this option. Empty Gloss If you add an empty gloss, no footnote will be given for the word at all: no parsing, no lexical form, no gloss. Usually this will not be the correct thing to do. You may wish to create an empty gloss if you are explaining the a phrase with a phrase gloss. Why would you add an empty gloss? If you leave a word without a gloss, the website will give you a warning because it will think you have forgotten to gloss the word. If you tell it you want an empty gloss, it knows you made the decision on purpose and will not give the warning. Phrase Glosses Sometimes it is helpful to add a gloss for a group of words. For instance, the combination of several words can have a meaning that is not predictable from the individual words. To add a phrase gloss, click the \u201cAdd a phrase gloss\u2026\u201d button at the bottom of the verse. Here is what you will see: Click on the words to select your phrase.

In 1 John 1:8 the idea is confession of sins: \u1f10\u1f70\u03bd \u1f41\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u1f77\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd, \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u1f79\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03b4\u1f77\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u1f00\u03c6\u1fc7 \u1f21\u03bc\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u1f77\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u1f77\u03c3\u1fc3 \u1f21\u03bc\u1fb6\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c0\u1f71\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f00\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u1f77\u03b1\u03c2.

Remember that most of the work is already done: we already have the Greek and Hebrew words parsed! You just need to provide translations for the Greek and Hebrew grammatical terms (e.g., indicative, nominative, qal, piel). This doesn\u2019t have to be set at the beginning of the project. You can enter the glosses without doing it. You just need to do it before you actually publish. Step By Step This section goes through the process of setting up a parsing format step-by-step. We\u2019ll come back to the idea of \u201cparsing format templates\u201d in the next section. To set up the parsing format for your project, go to the \u201cParsing Formats\u201d section of project settings. For each canon in your project (e.g., NT, OT), you will need at least one parsing format. Click the \u201cAdd Format\u2026\u201d button in the relevant section. The first step is to type in a name for your format\u2014it can be anything, so long as it\u2019s unique. Then you can select the parsing format template you want to use. We\u2019ll discuss this choice more in the next section. For this example, we\u2019ve called the parsing format \u201ctest\u201d and we\u2019ve chosen the \u201cOT Verbose\u201d template. Then click \u201cNext.\u201d The next step is to translate all of the terms: nominative, interrogative, suffix, passive, and so forth. You can see that the English names are filled in for you already. Once you\u2019ve translated all of the strings, click \u201cNext.\u201d Now you see a list of all of the possible parsings, for nouns and verbs. You can review this list to see if your parsings display correctly. (Typically the left column will have the English parsing, and your parsing will be shown in the right column. In this example we didn\u2019t take the trouble to enter in the grammatical terms for a different language.) There are lists for noun forms and verb forms. If you need to revise, click \u201cBack.\u201d If you are satisfied, click \u201cNext.\u201d The final step is just to save your parsing. Parsing Format Templates Parsings can be shown in different ways. We have three different types of parsings for each canon: verbose, concise, and templatic. Verbose parsing formats write out the parsing in long form. They are easy for beginners to read, but they will make the book longer. Concise parsing formats use abbreviations and numbers to express the full parsing in just a few characters. They are harder to read, but they make the book shorter (and are perhaps easier for experienced readers to use). A templatic format lets you customize the appearance of the parsing. For the Old Testament: OT Verbose: These parsings use lots of words. E.g., qal imperfect 3ms OT Concise: These parsings use abbreviations and numbers. E.g., G20 OT Templatic: This is for people who need to customize the appearance of their parsing more completely. For the New Testament: NT Verbose: These parsings use lots of words. E.g., present active indicative 3s NT Concise: These parsings use abbreviations and numbers. E.g., V3SAPI NT Templatic: This is for people who need to customize the appearance of their parsing more completely. Verbose Formats Old Testament In the OT Verbose Format, you get the following format for nouns and verbs. You decide whether to use full words (e.g., active) or abbreviations (e.g., act). Word Type Format Example Nouns noun state gender number noun active masculine singular Verbs stem tense person gender number qal imperfect 3rd fem sg Any Hebrew word can be preceded by an interrogative, or followed by a pronominal suffix. These are shown as follows: Word Type Format Example Interrogative , interrogative noun active masculine singular, interrog Pronominal Suffix , pronominial suffix person gender number qal imperfect 3rd fem sg, pron suff 2nd masc sg New Testament The NT Verbose Format produces parsings that look like the following. You decide whether to use full words (e.g., present) or abbreviations (e.g., pres). Word Type Format Example Nouns case gender number nominative masculine singular Finite Verbs tense voice mood person number aorist active indicative 3rd singular Participles tense voice participle gender case number present active participle masculine nominative singular Infinitives tense voice infinitive present active infinitive Concise Formats Old Testament The OT Concise Format uses a system of abbreviations that is widely used in biblical studies. (It has been attributed to LaSor\u2019s Handbook of Biblical Hebrew .) The BHS Reader\u2019s Edition provides this chart to summarize it. For this template, you only need to specify the correct abbreviations in your language. New Testament The NT Concise Format is another sort of generally used format for abbreviating parsings. Word Type Format Example Nouns N case gender number NAMS (i.e., noun accusative masculine singular) Verbs V person number tense voice mood V3SAAI (i.e., verb 3rd singular aorist active indicative) Participles VP tense voice case gender number VPPNMS (i.e., verb participle present passive nominative masculine singular) Infinitives VI tense voice VIPA (i.e., verb infinitive present active) Templatic Formats If you would like finer grained control over your parsings, you can specify your own templates. This calls for a little technical skill: enough at least to think carefully about where spaces and such go in a template string. The default templates produce the respective \u201cverbose\u201d parsing formats, so you can take those as a starting point. In the templates the string __TENSE__ will be replaced by the string you provide for the tense (e.g., imperfect or impf). Note that each of these elements is two underscore characters, a label in all caps, and then two more underscore characters. You can rearrange the elements, add or remove spaces and punctuation between them, or omit any of them that you wish. (If your language is right-to-left, it may be better to write out your template in a different place and then copy/paste it in.) Old Testament The noun and verb templates are the main ones. Then the pronominal suffix and interrogative templates are applied to any words that need them. Note that there is no space between the __NUMBER__ and the __PRONOMINAL_SUFFIX_TEMPLATE__ elements. That is because the pronominal suffix template begins with a comma and a space.

If you want to publish books in several different formats, see \u201cAdd a new publication configuration\u201d below. Select the parsing formats to use when publishing For each canon, you need to select the parsing format you want to use. If you haven\u2019t created a parsing format for a particular canon, you need to do that first in the Parsing Formats section. Font/language settings These are settings that make sure the book is typeset appropriately for your language. Select the typography language If your language is in the list, then just choose it. If your language is not in the list, then select the language whose documents look most like your language. For instance, if you write your language with the Cyrillic script, you might select \u201crussian\u201d. (You definitely want the script to match. You might be able to get closer; for instance both \u201crussian\u201d and \u201cbulgarian\u201d are options.) Technical detail you don\u2019t need to worry about: this is the language used by the polyglossia LaTeX package. Select the font for your language Choose the font that you want to use for your language. These are fonts that are available with open licenses. You can go to the Google Fonts to see samples. See Fonts for a little more detail. Using Google Fonts lets us automate the documentation creation project, and avoids concerns about copyright. If for some reason you need a font that is not part of Google Fonts, you can make it work, but it will be harder. See the do-it-yourself guide. Use SBL BibLit for the biblical text Using the SBL BibLit font is a really good idea. It is an attractive typeface and free. But if you want to use a different one, you can untick this box and select a Google Font instead. Chapter Headers This is a template so that you can create your language\u2019s equivalent of \u201cChapter 15\u201d. In this template \u201c__CHAPTER__\u201d will be replaced by the chapter number. In right-to-left languages, this is going to be awkward. Here is how I would do it: Copy the text \u201c__CHAPTER__\u201d to the clipboard (without the quotes). Remove all the text from the text box. Type in your \u201cchapter\u201d equivalent. Place your cursor where you want the chapter number to go (remember to include a space, if needed). Paste the text from the clipboard. Check in the \u201cExample\u201d below that it looks right. Footnotes This section is about what your footnote markers look like, i.e., the thing that comes after a word and tells you there is a footnote^a to look at. The reader\u2019s bibles we have seen seem to take two approaches to footnotes: Footnotes are indicated by letters (a, b, c, \u2026). The letters restart at the beginning of each verse. Footnotes are numbered. The numbering restarts on the page. (The advantage of using letters is that the footnote markers look very different from verse numbers.) If you\u2019re doing letters, how many footnote markers do you need? This will depend on the frequency threshold. The lower your threshold, the more words in a verse will need a gloss. As an example, if your frequency threshold for the Old Testament was 50, then you would need 31 different footnote markers. (That is for Daniel 3:15 \u2014 a very long verse that\u2019s in Aramaic.) If your frequency threshold was 100, then you would still need just 31 different footnote markers. If we run out of footnote markers, we start back at the beginning. So if you only specify \u201ca,b,c,d,e\u201d then the order of footnotes would be: \u201ca,b,c,d,e,a,b,c,d,e,a,b,c,d,e,\u2026\u201d. (That may not be bad; maybe your readers would able to figure it out.) Another strategy is to use doubled letters after you\u2019ve gone through all of the alphabet: \u201ca,b,c,d,e\u2026,x,y,z,aa,bb,cc,dd,ee\u2026\u201d. Custom Frequency Thresholds (advanced) One way you can customize a publication is by changing the frequency thresholds. You can use lower thresholds (i.e., providing less information to the reader) to produce editions for more advanced readers. The caution of course is that if these thresholds are higher than what you have set for your project, then there will just be blanks rather than glosses, because you haven\u2019t entered the glosses for them. LaTeX template (advanced) If you\u2019re a LaTeX user, you can use this to customize the .tex file that is used to build your PDFs. This allows you to customize your PDFs without going full DIY . You probably want to consult that guide, however, and the project\u2019s repository, to figure out the best way to modify this file. CSS template (advanced) You can change the CSS template that is used for the webpage version (HTML version) of the book. Specifically, the CSS on the website will be this file plus whatever you put in your CSS template. (What comes later in the CSS file has priority, so your changes will override whatever else in in that file.) These placeholders will be replaced with the fonts specified in the project settings: __BIBLICAL_FONT__ E.g., SBL BibLit __PROJECT_FONT__ E.g., Charis SIL __LAYOUT_DIRECTION__ E.g., rtl or ltr (this is the layout direction of the project language, e.g., Russian or Swahili) Add a new publication configuration At first you just have the \u201cdefault\u201d publication configuration. One project can have multiple publication configurations, however. You could have an edition with short parsing formats (e.g., G20) for advanced readers, and a different one with long parsing formats (e.g., qal imperfect third masculine singular) for beginning readers. You could have editions for A4 paper and Letter paper. \u2026or any other of the settings people might disagree about! You can click \u201cAdd a new publication configuration\u201d to create as many as you wish.
