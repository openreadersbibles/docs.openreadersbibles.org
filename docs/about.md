## Reader’s Bibles and Interlinear Bibles

An interlinear Bible is a version of the Bible where every word is translated (and perhaps parsed). It is a helpful resource, but it is not very easy to read.

A reader’s Bible is different. The text is laid out like a normal book. There are footnotes that help with parsing and word meanings, but these don’t interfere with your ability to read the text.

There is perhaps a deeper difference. An interlinear Bible is really for people who don’t really understand Greek or Hebrew. A reader’s Bible is for people who have studied Greek and Hebrew, but need occasional help. They are growing as readers.

The reader’s Bible actually makes you a better reader. If you always have to look up words in a dictionary or a parsing guide, then that slows you down. It’s frustrating. But if you can just have a little help with a word meaning here, or a parsing there, you can read more, and enjoy reading. And as you read, you get better at reading. You depend less and less on the footnotes.
