# Project Settings
## Project Members

Here you can add members to your projects (using the “Add a new member...” button).

You can also change user roles. Here are the roles:

- `admin` This is a person who can change anything about the project.
- `member` This is a person who can add and vote on glosses, but can't change project settings.
- `disabled` If some member behaves badly, you can disable them. Their votes will no longer count.

## Power user
We haven't implemented this yet; the button is there as a reminder for us.
