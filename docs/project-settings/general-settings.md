# Project Settings

## General Settings
Under the “Projects” page, you can find the “Settings” button under each project.

## The Basics
- “Project ID” is set once and then never changed, so you don't need to worry about it.
- “Project Title” is just the name for your project. This is what is displayed in the list of projects.
- “Project Description” can be as long or as short as you want. You might want to identify the goals of the project. You can include contact information here, but be cautious because you don't want to get spammed.
- “Layout Direction” Select whether your language is written left-to-right (like Greek) or right-to-left (like Hebrew and Aramaic).
- “Allow anyone to join” If this box is checked, anyone on the internet can join your project. (You can always remove them later.) Check this box if you want to encourage crowd-sourcing and collaboration.

## Gloss Suggestion Mode
It will be helpful to the reader to provide different glosses for different voices or verb stems (binyanim). See [Good glosses](good-glosses.md) under “Verbs” for further explanation of that.

The gloss suggestion mode determines what suggested glosses you see.

If you select “Show suggestions based on lexical item only” then you will see suggestions from all voices or verb stems. For instance, any time the verb βάλλω occurs, you will see a list including “to throw” and “to be thrown” — you can choose which one is better.

If you select “Show suggestions based on lexical item and voice/binyan” then you will only see suggested glosses that match the voice and/or binyan of the word. For instance, you would see “to throw” when βάλλω occurs in the active, and “to be thrown” when it occurs in the passive.

One reason to select “Show suggestions based on lexical item and voice/binyan” would be to force yourself to provide proper contextual glosses. On the other hand, it will mean that there will be more glosses to type in.

## Numerals
If your language uses numerals other than the Arabic numerals (0, 1, 2, 3...) you can enter them here.

Make sure to start with zero, end at nine, and include all the numerals in between.

Separate the numerals with an comma. Note that this has to be an left-to-right comma: ,

Example: This is what it should look like for English numerals:
```
0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
```

Example: This is what it should look like for Persian numerals:
```
۰,۱,۲,۳,۴,۵,۶,۷,۸,۹
```

## Settings to help your language display correctly on the website
These are settings that make your language display nicely on the website as you enter the glosses. For instance, you may have a font on your computer that you prefer to use. These settings do not affect how the books look when they are published. They only affect what the website looks like.
