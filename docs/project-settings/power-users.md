# Power Users

Power users are users who are given access to features that might cause serious damage.

Power users are not just [admin users](project-members.md). An admin may or may not be a power user.

Because power users can mess up the entire translation, you should really only give the authority to people who understand what they are doing. Don't make this a pride or status thing.

This page will describe power user features as they become available.

## Editing a gloss
Power users see an edit icon next to a gloss line. Click the icon to be change the text of the gloss.

The warning here is that this will change the gloss *everywhere* that it appears. If you edit the gloss for *Jesus* (Ἰησοῦς) in the gospel of Matthew, it will change it in Romans and Revelation as well. Everywhere.

This is really only appropriate the situation where someone has made a spelling mistake.

## Deleting a gloss
By clicking on the same edit icon, you will see the “Delete This Gloss” button. It will give you a warning message, and make you type “DELETE” into a box so that you don't just click OK by accident.

As with editing, this will delete that gloss *everywhere* in the project. The gloss will disappear. Any votes for the gloss will disappear. Consider how far this might set you back before you do this.
