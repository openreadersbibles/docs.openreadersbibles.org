# Project Settings

## Canons

In this section of the settings, you choose which canons your project will use. At this point, the options are Old Testament and New Testament. We hope to add the Septuagint in the future as well.

## Canons used in this project
Just tick the box for whatever canons you intend to work on.

## Frequency Thresholds
For each canon you should set a frequency threshold. For instance, if you want to gloss words that occur fewer than 10 times in the NT, then you would enter 10 in the “Frequency Threshold for NT” box.

See the section [“Deciding on frequency thresholds”](../frequency-thresholds.md) for discussion on this decision.

Changing this frequency threshold won't affect the data. Suppose you first set the threshold to 10. You work with that setting for a while, but then decide it's too much, so you set the threshold to 30 instead. There will no longer be a prompt for a word to be glossed if it occurs 20 times, but the data are still there. If you ever change your mind and change the threshold back to 10, your old data will still be there.

## Book names
This is just a form for you to enter the names of the books in the canon, in the project langauge (e.g., Génesis, Éxodo, Levítico, ...).
