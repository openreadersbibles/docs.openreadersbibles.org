# Overview of Publication

To publish your books, from the main menu go to “Projects” and then click the “Advanced” button and then “Publication.” (Note that you need to be a project owner to do this.) You are taken to a page that takes you through the steps for publication.

## 1. Confirm the publication settings
This screen merely shows you your project's publication settings so that you can check if they look right. If you need to change something, you'll need to follow the link to the project settings.

| Setting   | Description  |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Project Language Font   | Charis SIL  |
| Biblical Language Font  | SBL BibLit  |
| Typography Language     | english     |
| Numbers                 | 1234567890  |
| Sample Chapter Header   | Chapter 15  |
| First ten footnotes     | a b c d e f g h i j |

- Project Language Font — This should be a font that looks good with your language.
- Biblical Language Font — This should be SBL BibLit unless you have a specific reason for choosing something else.
- Typography Language — This is either your language, or a language whose documents look like your documents. (For instance, if your language is Kazakh, Russian is probably the best choice. If it's Mixtec, Spanish might be the best choice.)
- Numbers — This should show your language's numbers from 1 though 0.
- Sample Chapter Header — This is what a chapter header will look like.
- First ten footnotes — This shows the sequence of footnote markers. Depending on the language this might be different letters, or symbols, or numbers.

Again, if something doesn't look right, fix it in the project's settings.

## 2. Select parsing formats
Choose a parsing format for each canon.

## 3. Choose books
Select the books you want to publish.

## 4. Check books
The books you've selected will be checked for missing glosses and things like that.

After a moment, you will either see something like “Success: Genesis” or a description of the error.

## 5. Publish
Click “Publish” to create the PDFs.

This will take a few minutes. (If you selected a lot of books, it might take some time.)

You can leave this page if you need to. It will continue in the background. You can check in on your files later in the “PDFs” section of the Projects page.
