### Footnote Markers
How many footnote markers do you need?

This will depend on the frequency threshold. The lower your threshold, the more words in a verse will need a gloss. As an example, if your frequency threshold for the Old Testament was 50, then you would need 31 different footnote markers. (That is for Daniel 3:15 — a very long verse that's in Aramaic.) If your frequency threshold was 100, then you would need 31 different footnote markers.

If we run out of footnote markers, we start back at the beginning. So if you only specify “a,b,c,d,e” then the order of footnotes would be: “a,b,c,d,e,a,b,c,d,e,a,b,c,d,e,...”. (That may not be bad; maybe your readers would able to figure it out.)

Another strategy is to use doubled letters after you've gone through all of the alphabet: “a,b,c,d,e...,x,y,z,aa,bb,cc,dd,ee...”.
