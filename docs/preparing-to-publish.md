# Preparing to publish

Before you can publish your work, you need to tell the site how you want it to look. They key concepts here are “parsing format” and “publication configuration.” These are described below. The short version is: you need to create at least one parsing format, and set your publication configuration to use that parsing format.

## Parsing Formats
A parsing format is the way that the parsing for each verb and noun will be shown. Consider the word θεόν.

- One person might prefer to show the parsing as “accusative masculine singular”
- Another person might prefer to show the parsing as “NAMS”

So you need to set this up. You'll go to your project settings, and then to the “Parsing Formats” tab.

The documentation for [parsing formats](project-settings/parsing-formats.md) has more detail.

A tip: if you just want to get started, you can create a parsing format with the default values. Then you can go back and translate it properly later.

## Publication Configurations
Go to the “Publication Configurations” tab of project settings, and change the settings there. (Every project has the “default” publication configuration at the beginning, so you can use that.)

The most important setting is right at the top: for each canon in your project, select the parsing format that you created just now.

There are also other important settings here, which are described under [publication configurations](project-settings/publication-configurations.md).

## Now you're all set
Once you've done this, you're [ready to publish](publication-overview.md).
