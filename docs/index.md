# Open Reader's Bibles

A reader’s Bible is a Bible that has the original language text of the Bible, alongside of glosses , parsings, and footnotes that help people to understand the text. The goal is to help someone who understands the original languages to be able to read the Bible without constantly having to refer to a dictionary or a parsing chart. They are very helpful for people who have studied the languages for a year or so, and need a bridge to be able to read the Bible fluently in the original languages.

Reader’s Bibles are generally published by for-profit companies. They need to cover the expense of producing the book. This has two consequences. First, the books are rather expensive (like a textbook). Second, reader’s Bibles are generally only available in languages that have a lot of customers.

This is a website that will help you to produce your own reader’s Bible. It is a lot of work, but we’ve worked hard to make it as simple as possible. Then you can produce high quality PDFs or web pages from your hard work—and you can give them away for free.
The hope here is that people from all over the world will be able to benefit from these wonderful resources.

## A more personal introduction
After I finished third-semester Hebrew, I had still read very little of the Hebrew Bible. I knew that if I didn’t use it, I would forget it. And so I set myself the goal of being able to read the Psalms without having to use a dictionary. After one or two years, I achieved that goal. But I was exhausted! I knew that at that rate I might never read through the entire Old Testament.

Somewhat reluctantly, I bought a Hebrew reader’s Bible. At first I was ashamed: I thought of it as a cheater’s edition. But then I began to read from it daily, and I saw how helpful it was. After several more years, I had read completely through the Old Testament. I knew that never would have happened if I had just been relying on BHS and a dictionary.

Somewhere in those years, I began to wish that there could be a reader’s Bible in one of the languages that is near to my heart. I sent an email to the publisher of a Greek reader’s Bible. They replied with a sensible question: how many copies did I think it would sell? But I knew that that was the end of the idea: we would be lucky to sell a few hundred copies. So I set the idea aside.

As I continued to read in my reader’s Bible, I thought about how it had been produced. As a computer person, I could see that a database was involved. I found myself getting distracted in my devotions, thinking about how I would code that sort of system.

Fairly soon after I finished reading through the Old Testament for the first time, I was at a conference with a lot of Russians. I was doing my devotions in the hotel lobby, and a new Russian friend sat down. He was a pastor, and also fluent in English. He noticed the book, and said that he had the same one: someone had brought it in for him specially in Russia. I was glad that he too was able to use it, but I was also upset. First, he could only get that book because he knew an expatriate who could bring it in for him. Second, he could only benefit from it because he already knew English. How many more Russians would benefit from a Russian reader’s Bible? How many people of other languages would also benefit?

## A personal invitation and challenge
Learning Greek and Hebrew is a lot of work! In the English-speaking world, we are blessed with many valuable resources. Many people around the world can only learn Greek or Hebrew if they learn a second academic language first—perhaps English, German, Spanish, or French. If that describes you: well done! Those of us who learned in our native language from the beginning are in awe of your hard work and dedication. 

We would like to challenge you here to think about your fellow countrymen. You have overcome a lot of obstacles and difficulties to be able to read the Bible in the original languages. Will you now help others to get there as well? Will you help the next generation, so that they don’t have to go through all of the difficult work that you did?

The goal of this website is to make it as easy as possible to produce a reader’s Bible in your language. It is still not easy, but it is as easy as it can be. It will also take care of all of the publishing difficulties. So there should be very little holding you back. Can you commit a short time each day to work on developing a resource that will help future generations?
