## Which books to tackle first
I think it is fun to finish something, so I started with short books. In the NT, 1, 2 or 3 John are very nice. After that, the gospel of John is pretty quick. This gives you a great start: once you've finished those two books, about a third of the words in any of the gospels will already have glosses. If you move on to Mark next, more than half of the words in the *New Testament* will have glosses. 

In the OT, Ruth and Jonah are good ones to start with.

## Workflow
I keep two windows open. The first is the Open Reader's Bibles website itself. The second has 1) a literal translation in the target language, 2) the original Greek or Hebrew.

It's nice to have a target translation available, because you can copy/paste names and things like that.

It's nice to have the original language, because you can search. (E.g., “I just now realized there's a better gloss for this word, but I think it came up once before. Where was that?”)

## Consistency
It's good to decide on some glossing practices beforehand. Here are some ideas.

- Nouns will always be singular.
- Verbs will always be in the infinitive form.
- Verbs will always be glossed in their active form. (Or alternately, verbs with be glossed with an active or passive form, depending on context.)

## Non-obvious tricks

- Double-click on a source language word for an English gloss and full parsing.
