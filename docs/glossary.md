# Glossary

**Gloss** — A simple, one-word definition of a word. A gloss doesn't communicate all of the possible translations of a word, so one word can have more than one possible gloss.

**Parsing** — A parsing of a word is all of the grammtical information about that word. Nouns may have number, case, or gender. Verbs may have tense. These are different for different languages. Examples:
* βίβλος — nominative feminine singular
* ἐγέννησεν — aorist active indicative, 3rd singular
* בָּרָא — qal perfect, 3rd masculine singular

Parsings can be shown in different ways. The parsings above might be abbreviated as “NFS,” “AAI3S,” or “G10” for instance.
