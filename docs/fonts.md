# Fonts

This page describes your options for publication fonts. Remember, the publication font is the font that is used in your PDF files. (It might be different from the font you prefer to use on the computer screen.)

## For Biblical Languages
We have also made [SBL BitLit](https://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_SBLBibLit.aspx) available. This is a  beautiful and readable that many publishers use. It should be your first choice. If you don't wish to use SBL BibLit, you can choose one of the Google Fonts (for which see below).

## For Other languages
We have made all of the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) available. You can search that website and find an appropriate font, and then use that for your publication. (The Google Fonts include fonts from SIL, which cover many alphabets.) By including the Google Fonts, we hope to have achieved pretty good coverage of the world's alphabets.

If your language uses Latin script, Charis SIL is an excellent choice.

Although in principle we are happy to add additional fonts to the system, they need to be fonts that we have the right to use (i.e., they need to be released under an open license). If you have a proprietary font that you prefer to use, you could still use it if you create the PDFs on your own computer. See [this page](DIY.md) for details on that.
